If this provision is invoked, evervault will not be liable to Customer under the Agreement for any failure to perform the applicable Services until such time as Customer issues new lawful Instructions with regard to the Processing.</p><p><em>Security</em></p><p>evervault shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data from Personal Data Breaches, as described under Annex 2 to this DPA (&quot;Security Measures&quot;). Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, evervault may modify or update the Security Measures at its discretion provided that such modification or update does not result in a material degradation in the protection offered by the Security Measures.</p><p><em>Confidentiality</em></p><p>evervault shall ensure that any personnel whom evervault authorizes to Process Personal Data on its behalf is subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations (whether a contractual or statutory duty) with respect to that Personal Data.</p><p><em>Personal Data Breaches</em></p><p>evervault will notify Customer without undue delay after it becomes aware of any Personal Data Breach and shall provide timely information relating to the Personal Data Breach as it becomes known or reasonably requested by Customer. At Customer’s request, evervault will promptly provide Customer with such reasonable assistance as necessary to enable Customer to notify relevant Personal Data Breaches to competent authorities and/or affected Data Subjects, if Customer is required to do so under Data Protection Laws.</p><p><em>Deletion or Return of Personal Data</em></p><p>evervault will delete or return all Personal Data (including copies thereof) Processed pursuant to this DPA in accordance with the procedures and timeframes set out in the Agreement, save that this requirement shall not apply to the extent evervault is required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Personal Data, or to Personal Data it has archived on back-up systems, which data evervault shall securely isolate and protect from any further Processing and delete in accordance with its deletion practices.</p><p><strong>4. Data Subject Requests</strong></p><p>The Services provide Customer with a number of controls that Customer may use to retrieve, correct, delete or restrict Personal Data, which Customer may use to assist it in connection with its obligations under Data Protection Laws, including its obligations relating to responding to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under applicable Data Protection Laws (&quot;Data Subject Requests&quot;). To the extent that Customer is unable to independently address a Data Subject Request through the Services, then upon Customer’s written request evervault shall provide reasonable assistance to Customer to respond to any Data Subject Requests or requests from data protection authorities relating to the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement.

Before engaging any Sub-Processor, we perform due diligence, including security and legal analysis. We do not engage a Sub-Processor unless our quality standards are met. Our Sub-Processors are all subject to contract terms that enforce compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p><p>evervault currently uses the following Sub-Processors:</p><p><strong>SUB-PROCESSOR SERVICE PROVIDED LOCATION OF THE SUB-PROCESSOR</strong></p><p>Amazon Web Services Cloud service provider EU / United States of America</p><p>Auth0 Authentication provider United States of America</p><p>Salesforce CRM United States of America</p><p>Google Business Management EU / United States of America</p><p>Google Analytics EU / United States of America</p><p>Plausible Analytics EU</p><p>Intercom Chat functionality/bot EU / United States of America</p><p>Send Grid Email Marketing EU / United States of America</p><p>Salesforce CRM EU / United States of America</p><p>Slack Communications EU / United States of America</p><p>Stripe Payments EU / United States of America</p><p>Our business needs may change from time to time. For example, we may deprecate a Sub-Processor to consolidate and minimise our use of Sub-Processors. Similarly, we may add a Sub-Processor if we believe that doing so will enhance our ability to deliver our Services. We will periodically update this page to reflect additions and removals to our list of Sub-Processors.</p><p>Customer agrees that evervault may engage Sub-Processors to Process Personal Data on Customer&#x27;s behalf. evervault has currently appointed, as Sub-Processors, the evervault Entities and third parties listed above. evervault is granted a general authorisation to subcontract the Processing of Personal Data to Sub-Processors. evervault shall notify Customer if it adds or removes Sub-Processors listed on the prior to any such changes, if Customer opts-in to receive such email notifications by completing the form available here.

If and to the extent the Standard Contractual Clauses (where applicable) conflict with any provision of this DPA, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.</p><p><em>Demonstration of compliance</em></p><p>evervault shall make available to Customer all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections by Customer in order to assess compliance with this DPA. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it shall exercise its audit rights under this DPA by instructing evervault to comply with the audit measures described in this section. Customer acknowledges that the Services are hosted by evervault&#x27;s data centre partners who maintain independently validated security programs and evervault&#x27;s systems are regularly tested by independent third party penetration testing firms. At Customer&#x27;s written request, evervault will provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all reasonable requests for information made by Customer necessary to confirm evervault&#x27;s compliance with this DPA, provided that Customer shall not exercise this right more than once per calendar year.</p><p><strong>8.

The Customer entity that is the contracting entity is responsible for coordinating all communication with evervault under the DPA and shall be entitled to make and receive any communication related to this DPA on behalf of its Permitted Affiliates.</p><p><em>Other rights</em></p><p>The parties agree that Customer shall, when reviewing evervault&#x27;s compliance with this DPA pursuant to Section 7 (<em>Demonstration of Compliance</em>), take all reasonable measures to limit any impact on evervault and its affiliates by combining several audit requests carried out on behalf of the Customer entity that is the contracting party to the Agreement and all of its Permitted Affiliates in one single audit.</p><p><strong>Annex 1 - Details of Processing</strong></p><p>This Annex forms part of the DPA.</p><p><em>Nature and Purpose of Processing:</em> evervault will Process Personal Data as necessary to provide the Services pursuant to the Agreement, as further specified in the Order Form, and as further instructed by Customer in its use of the Services.</p><p><em>Duration of Processing:</em> Subject to the &quot;Deletion or Return of Personal Data&quot; section of this DPA, evervault will Process Personal Data for the duration of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p><p><em>Categories of Data subjects:</em> Customer may submit Personal Data in the course of using the Services, the extent of which is determined and controlled by Customer in its sole discretion, and which may include, but is not limited to Personal Data relating to the following categories of Data Subjects: Customer’s Contacts and other end users including Customer’s employees, contractors, collaborators, customers, prospects, suppliers and subcontractors.

Access is enabled through “just in time” requests for access; all such requests are logged. Employees are granted access by role, and reviews of high risk privilege grants are initiated daily. Employee roles are reviewed at least once every six months.</p><p>Employee compliance: All evervault employees are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with company guidelines, non-disclosure requirements, and ethical standards.</p><p><em>Transmission Control</em></p><p>In-transit: evervault makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS) available on every one of its login interfaces and for free on every customer site hosted on the evervault products. evervault’s HTTPS implementation uses industry standard algorithms and certificates.</p><p>At-rest: evervault stores user passwords following policies that follow industry standard practices for security. evervault has implemented technologies to ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest.</p><p><em>Input Control</em></p><p>Detection: evervault designed its infrastructure to log extensive information about the system behavior, traffic received, system authentication, and other application requests. Internal systems aggregated log data and alert appropriate employees of malicious, unintended, or anomalous activities. evervault personnel, including security, operations, and support personnel, are responsive to known incidents.</p><p>Response and tracking: evervault maintains a record of known security incidents that includes description, dates and times of relevant activities, and incident disposition. Suspected and confirmed security incidents are investigated by security, operations, or support personnel; and appropriate resolution steps are identified and documented. For any confirmed incidents, evervault will take appropriate steps to minimise product and Customer damage or unauthorised disclosure. Notification to Customer will be in accordance with the terms of the DPA or Agreement.</p><p><em>Availability Control</em></p><p>Infrastructure availability: The infrastructure providers use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure a minimum of 99.95% uptime. The providers maintain a minimum of N+1 redundancy to power, network, and HVAC services.</p><p>Fault tolerance: Backup and replication strategies are designed to ensure redundancy and fail-over protections during a significant processing failure. Customer data is backed up to multiple durable data stores and replicated across multiple availability zones.</p><p>Online replicas and backups: Where feasible, production databases are designed to replicate data between no less than 1 primary and 1 secondary database. All databases are backed up and maintained using at least industry standard methods.</p><p>evervault’s products are designed to ensure redundancy and seamless failover. The server instances that support the products are also architected with a goal to prevent single points of failure. This design assists evervault operations in maintaining and updating the product applications and backend while limiting downtime.</p><p><strong>Annex 3 - Standard Contractual Clauses</strong></p><p>For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, the Customer, as defined in the evervault Services Agreement (the “data exporter”); and evervault Limited (the “data importer”), each a ‘party’; together ‘the parties’ HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.</p><p><strong>Clause 1: Definitions</strong></p><p>For the purposes of the Clauses:</p><p>‘personal data’, ‘special categories of data’, ‘process/processing’, ‘controller’, ‘processor’, ‘data subject’ and ‘supervisory authority’ shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data;</p><p>‘the data exporter’ means the controller who transfers the personal data;</p><p>‘the data importer’ means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country’s system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;</p><p>&#x27;the subprocessor’ means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other subprocessor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other subprocessor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;</p><p>‘the applicable data protection law’ means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established;</p><p>‘technical and organisational security measures’ means those measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.</p><p><strong>Clause 2: Details of the transfer</strong></p><p>The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses.</p><p><strong>Clause 3: Third-party beneficiary clause</strong></p><ol>
