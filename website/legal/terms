or &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot;) and the entity or person (&quot;<strong>Customer</strong>&quot;,

Account</strong>&quot;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By creating an evervault Account or by accessing or using the
Services, you acknowledge and agree that you have read,
understand and agree to be bound by this Agreement. You further
acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand our
Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, please do not access or use the Services.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may amend or update the terms of this Agreement at any time,
solely with prospective effect or change, delete, discontinue,
or impose conditions on use of the Services by posting such
changes on our website or any other website we maintain or own.
We will provide you with notice of any material changes through
the website, via email, or through other reasonable means. If
you are an existing evervault user, the changes will come into
effect on the date we specify in the notice, and your use of the
Services after a change has taken effect constitutes your
acceptance of the terms of the modified Agreement. You can
access a copy of the current terms of this Agreement on our
website at any time. You can find out when this Agreement was
last changed by checking the &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top of

<ol>
<li>
<p>To access the Services, you must register for an evervault
Account by creating a user name, password and providing other
information. You agree to provide us with accurate, complete,
and current registration information about yourself. It is your
responsibility to ensure that your password remains confidential
and secure. By registering, you agree that you are fully
responsible for all activities that occur under your user name
and password. We may assume that any communications we receive
under your account have been made by you. If you are a billing
owner, an administrator, or if you have confirmed in writing
that you have the authority to make decisions on behalf of a
customer (&quot;<strong>Account Administrator</strong>&quot;), you represent and
warrant that you are authorized to make decisions on behalf of
the Customer and agree that evervault is entitled to rely on
your instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are responsible for notifying us
at <a href="mailto:support@evervault.com%20">support@evervault.com</a> if
you become aware of any unauthorized use of or access to your
account. You understand and agree that we may require you to
provide information that may be used to confirm your identity
and help ensure the security of your account. evervault will not
be liable for any loss, damages, liability, expenses or legal
fees that you may incur as a result of someone else using your
password or account, either with or without your knowledge
and/or authorization, and regardless of whether you have or have
not advised us of such unauthorized use. You will be liable for
losses, damages, liability, expenses and legal fees incurred by
evervault or a third party due to someone else using your
account. In the event that the Account Administrator or Customer
loses access to an account or otherwise requests information
about an evervault Account, evervault reserves the right to
request from the Account Administrator or Customer any
verification it deems necessary before restoring access to or
providing information about such account in its sole discretion.</p>

owned, directly or indirectly, by an individual who is not at
least 18 years old, but is 13 years old or older, your
Representative must either obtain the consent of your board or
of an authorised officer to create an evervault Account. Any
such approving board, authorised officer, parent, or legal
guardian is responsible to evervault and is legally bound to
this Agreement as if it had agreed to the terms of this
Agreement itself. You may not use the Services if you are under
13 years of age.</p>

information you provided, verify you or your Representative&#x27;s
identity, and assess the risk associated with your business.
This additional information may include business invoices,
copies of government-issued identification, business licences,
or other information related to your business, its beneficial
owners or principals. Your failure to provide this information
or material may result in suspension or termination of your
evervault Account.</p>

service providers and other third parties, including credit
reporting agencies and information bureaus and you authorise and

information to us. You acknowledge that this may include your

your Representative. You acknowledge that we may use your

and that any information we collect may affect our assessment of
your overall risk to our business. You acknowledge that in some

your evervault Account. evervault may periodically update this
information as part of our underwriting criteria and risk
analysis procedures.</p>

emailed to you.</p>

evervault will use SMS, email or another secure procedure to
contact you. Standard text or data charges may apply to such
notices. Due to the nature of the Services, you will not be able

<li>
<p>evervault is responsible for protecting the security of Data in
our possession. We will maintain commercially reasonable
administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect
User Data and Personal Data stored in our servers from
unauthorised access, accidental loss, modification, or breach,
and we will comply with applicable laws when we handle User and
Personal Data. However, no security system is impenetrable and
we cannot guarantee that unauthorised parties will never be able
to defeat our security measures or misuse any Data in our

including suspension of your evervault Account, to maintain the
integrity and security of the Services or Data, or to prevent
harm to you, us, customers, or others. You waive any right to

from such actions where we can demonstrate that there was a
reasonable basis for such action.</p>

business, and selecting and implementing Security Controls
appropriate to mitigate your exposure to security incidents. We

suggest that you implement specific Security Controls. However,
your responsibility for securing your business is not diminished
by any Security Controls that we provide or suggest, and if you
believe that the Security Controls we provide are insufficient,
then you must separately implement additional controls that meet
your requirements. You warrant that you have conducted
appropriate due diligence on the evervault Services and Security
Controls necessary for your business.</p>
