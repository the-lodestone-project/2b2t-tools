1. Open your terminal.
2. Pull the Docker image from the Docker Hub using the following command:

```bash
docker pull SOON!
```

After pulling the image, run the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 SOON!
```

This command will start 2b2t tools and map it to port 5000 on your local machine.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/docs to access the docs and api endpoints.
